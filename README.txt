READ ME!!

1. There is Game.java and Draw.java. In mine it's in a file called hw00 I'm not sure it that matters.

2. Run it java Game dictionary.txt (or whatever your test file is called) through the command line

3. I made it small and everything has its own side so it would be easy to see

4. Lots of issues but I think thats from lack of knowledge with guis. Everything was hard to make work haha. Specifically, texts field, the button, making sure it was putting both letters in etc...
